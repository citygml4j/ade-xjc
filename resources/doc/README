3. About
--------

ade-xjc is a command line tool and wrapper for the XML Schema binding compiler
xjc shipped with JAXB. ade-xjc compiles an arbitrary CityGML ADE Schema
to a set of corresponding JAXB classes to be used with citygml4j. 

ade-xjc ensures that the resulting JAXB classes are correctly derived from
and related to the CityGML, GML and xAL JAXB classes shipped with citygml4j,
and thus that they can be directly used with the citygml4j library. The citygml4j
library needs to be on your classpath in order to use the generated classes
in your application.

ade-xjc is part of the citygml4j project.


4. System requirements
----------------------

* Java JRE or JDK >= @javaCompatibility@ to launch the ade-xjc binding compiler
* citygml4j v@version@ to use the generated JAXB classes


5. How to use it
----------------

ade-xjc is a command line tool. In order to get a list of supported
arguments, invoke the tool in a shell environment:

  % java -jar @jar@ -help

The ade-xjc compiler requires that your ADE schema points to the official
CityGML and GML schemas provided in the subfolder "schemas". So please 
adapt all <xs:import> statements in your ADE schema accordingly before 
invoking the ade-xjc compiler.

A sample ADE schema together with an ANT build.xml file is provided in the
subfolder "sample". Simply run the build.xml with Ant using the default
target to compile the sample ADE to JAXB classes.
