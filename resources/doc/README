3. About
--------

@appName@ is a command line tool and wrapper for the XML Schema binding compiler
xjc shipped with JAXB. @appName@ compiles an arbitrary CityGML ADE Schema
to a set of corresponding JAXB classes to be used with citygml4j. 

@appName@ ensures that the resulting JAXB classes are correctly derived from and
related to the CityGML, GML and xAL JAXB classes shipped with citygml4j, and
thus that they can be directly used with the citygml4j library. The citygml4j
library needs to be on your classpath in order to use the generated classes
in your application.

@appName@ is part of the citygml4j project.


4. System requirements
----------------------

* Java JRE or JDK >= @javaCompatibility@ to launch the @appName@ binding compiler
* citygml4j v@citygml4jVersion@ to use the generated JAXB classes


5. How to use it
----------------

@appName@ is a command line tool. Use the start scripts to launch the
application. The start scripts are located in the root folder of the
installation directory.

Please execute the start script suitable for your platform:
- @appName@.bat   (Microsoft Windows family)
- @appName@       (UNIX/Linux family, macOS)

To get a list of supported arguments, open a shell environment, change
directory to the installation directory of @appName@, and invoke to following
command.

  % @appName@ -help

The @appName@ compiler requires that your ADE schema points to the official
CityGML and GML schemas provided in the subfolder "schemas". So please 
adapt all <xs:import> statements in your ADE schema accordingly before 
invoking the @appName@ compiler.

A sample ADE schema together with "run-sample" start scripts is provided in
the subfolder "sample". Simply run the start script for your platform to
compile the sample ADE to JAXB classes.
